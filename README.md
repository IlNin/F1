# Formula-Driver
A 3D game developed using the Three.js library where you drive a Formula 1 car and dodge incoming traffic.<br/>
<b>Features:</b>
- Steer your Formula 1 car to right and left in order to dodge incoming traffic. Every time you pass 50 opponent cars, your car will go even faster: how far can you get?
- Choose your team between Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull: this affects your car's colors and logo.
- Switch between cockpit view and third person by pressing 'v'.
- Customizable difficulty settings and graphic options, such as resolution, shadows and fog effects.


<b>Comments:</b><br/>
This was the final project required to pass an exam that dealt with OpenGL and (optionally) other libraries that uses it as their basis.
Since I had the option, I decided to drop "vanilla" OpenGL for this one and switch to Three.js, which made a tremendous difference in how fast I could write my code. It genuinely felt that for each line of code in Three.js I could do the same amount of work that required countless lines of codes with OpenGL.
Regarding the inspiration behind the project (we could do anything, as long as it satisfied some requirements), I've recently become a huge Formula 1 fan, so I wanted to honor my new passion with this little game. 
I had to write a report for this project, so for more information you can read that!
